## EMAIL 1 — Immediately

**Subject Line:** The Swimsuit Colors That Can Make Your Child Invisible

**Preview Text:** Plus which colors lifeguards recommend most

---

### Welcome to the Aqua Journey Family!

Thank you for joining us. As promised, here's the water safety information every parent needs to know.

---

### Can You Spot the Difference?

Recent studies by the Alive Solutions drowning prevention organization tested swimsuit visibility in pools and lakes. The results were alarming.

---

### AVOID These Colors in the Water

**Light Blue / White / Pastels**
These colors virtually disappear in pool water. Light blue blends directly into the pool floor and water.

**Green / Camouflage**
In lakes and natural water, green swimsuits become invisible against algae, plants, and murky bottoms.

**Gray / Light Purple**
In both pools and lakes, these fade into shadows and become nearly impossible to see from above.

---

### CHOOSE These High-Visibility Colors

**Neon Orange** — #1 recommended by lifeguards
Visible in ALL water conditions, even murky lakes.

**Bright Pink / Hot Pink**
Stands out dramatically against blue pool water and dark lake bottoms.

**Neon Yellow / Lime Green**
High contrast in pools and open water. Easy to track from a distance.

**Bright Red**
A classic choice that remains visible in most conditions.

---

### The 30-Second Rule

Even with the brightest swimsuit, active supervision is critical. Follow these guidelines:

- **Eyes on the water** — no phones, books, or distractions
- **Scan every 30 seconds** — know where your child is at all times
- **Arm's reach** — stay within reach for children under 5 or non-swimmers
- **Designated watcher** — take turns with other adults, no assumptions

---

### Ready for Swim Lessons?

The best protection is teaching your child to swim. At Aqua Journey, our heated 90°F pool and experienced instructors make learning comfortable and fun.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 3

**Subject Line:** The #1 Mistake Parents Make at the Pool

**Preview Text:** It only takes 20 seconds for a child to drown silently

---

### Drowning Doesn't Look Like Drowning

Most parents picture splashing and screaming. The reality? Drowning is almost always silent.

---

### Why Drowning Goes Unnoticed

When someone is drowning, their body goes into survival mode:

- **No splashing** — arms push down to stay afloat, not wave for help
- **No yelling** — all energy goes to breathing, not calling out
- **Head low** — mouth bobs at water level, often tilted back
- **Vertical body** — no kicking, just trying to stay upright
- **20-60 seconds** — that's how fast it happens

Children playing are loud. A drowning child is quiet. **If it suddenly gets silent, look immediately.**

---

### The "10/20" Rule Lifeguards Use

Professional lifeguards follow this standard:

- Every **10 seconds** — scan your entire zone
- Within **20 seconds** — reach any swimmer

At home, you're the lifeguard. This means:

- **Uninterrupted watching** — no phones, conversations, or "quick" tasks
- **One designated watcher** — never assume someone else is watching
- **Verbal handoffs** — "I'm watching now" / "I need you to take over"
- **Position yourself** — sit where you can see the entire pool

---

### The Danger Zones

**Most drownings happen when:**

- During parties or gatherings (too many adults = no one watching)
- When a child is "done swimming" but goes back to the water
- In the last 10 minutes before leaving
- When parents step away "just for a second"

---

### Make It a Rule

Create a family water safety rule that's non-negotiable:

> **"No water without a Water Watcher."**

Use a physical object — a bright wristband, lanyard, or card — that the designated watcher wears. When you pass it, you pass responsibility.

---

**Want your child to be safer in the water?**

Swim lessons dramatically reduce drowning risk. Our instructors teach not just swimming, but water safety and self-rescue skills.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 7

**Subject Line:** Would You Know What to Do? (2 Minutes to Save a Life)

**Preview Text:** The CPR steps every parent should memorize

---

### Every Parent Should Know This

In a drowning emergency, brain damage begins in 4-6 minutes. Emergency services take an average of 7-10 minutes to arrive.

**You are your child's first responder.**

---

### If You Find a Child Unresponsive in Water

**Step 1: Get Them Out**
Remove them from the water immediately. Support their head and neck.

**Step 2: Check for Response**
Tap their shoulders firmly. Shout their name. Look for breathing (chest rising).

**Step 3: Call 911**
If unresponsive, call 911 immediately (or have someone call while you start CPR).

**Step 4: Start CPR**

**For children (1-8 years):**

1. Place heel of one hand on center of chest
2. Push hard and fast — 2 inches deep, 100-120 pushes per minute
3. After 30 compressions, tilt head back, lift chin, give 2 breaths
4. Repeat: 30 compressions, 2 breaths
5. Don't stop until help arrives or child responds

**For infants (under 1 year):**

1. Use 2 fingers on center of chest (just below nipple line)
2. Push 1.5 inches deep, 100-120 per minute
3. Cover mouth AND nose with your mouth for breaths
4. 30 compressions, 2 breaths, repeat

---

### The Beat to Remember

Push to the beat of "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees — it's exactly 100 beats per minute.

---

### Take a CPR Class

Reading about CPR isn't the same as practicing it. We strongly recommend taking a hands-on course:

- **American Red Cross** — redcross.org/take-a-class
- **American Heart Association** — cpr.heart.org
- **Local fire departments** — many offer free community classes

A 2-hour class could save your child's life.

---

### Free Resource

Download the American Red Cross **First Aid app** — it has step-by-step CPR instructions with audio guidance for emergencies.

Available on iOS and Android

## EMAIL 4 — Day 14

**Subject Line:** The Hidden Water Dangers in Your Home

**Preview Text:** Bathtubs, buckets, and backyard hazards most parents overlook

---

### Water Dangers Beyond the Pool

When we think about drowning, we picture pools and beaches. But for children under 4, most drowning incidents happen at **home**.

---

### The Surprising Statistics

- **Bathtubs** — #1 location for infant drowning
- **Buckets & containers** — a toddler can drown in just 2 inches of water
- **Toilets** — top-heavy toddlers can fall in headfirst and get stuck
- **Pet bowls, coolers, fountains** — any standing water is a risk

---

### Room-by-Room Safety Checklist

**Bathroom**

- [ ] Never leave children under 5 alone in the bath — not even for a moment
- [ ] Drain the tub immediately after use
- [ ] Install toilet seat locks
- [ ] Keep bathroom doors closed or use door knob covers

**Backyard**

- [ ] Empty kiddie pools after every use (store upside down)
- [ ] Fence pools on all 4 sides with self-closing, self-latching gates
- [ ] Remove pool ladders for above-ground pools when not in use
- [ ] Cover hot tubs with locked, rigid covers
- [ ] Fence ponds and water features

**Around the House**

- [ ] Empty mop buckets immediately
- [ ] Store buckets upside down or out of reach
- [ ] Don't leave coolers with melted ice accessible
- [ ] Be aware of neighbors' pools — kids wander

---

### Layers of Protection

No single safety measure is enough. Use multiple layers:

```
Supervision (constant adult watching)
        +
Barriers (fences, locks, covers)
        +
Alarms (door alarms, pool alarms)
        +
Skills (swim lessons, water safety education)
        =
Maximum Protection
```

---

### The 4-Sided Fence Rule

If you have a pool, fencing should:

- Be at least **4 feet tall**
- Surround the pool on **all 4 sides** (house walls don't count)
- Have **self-closing and self-latching gates**
- Have latches **out of children's reach**

This alone reduces drowning risk by **83%**.

---

### It's a Great Time to Start (or Continue)

Our pool is heated to 90°F year-round, so there's never a bad time for lessons.

### Vacation Water Safety

Traveling somewhere with water? Remember:

- Watch for rip currents — swim parallel to shore to escape

**Boats**
- Coast Guard-approved life jackets for all children
- Life jackets ON at all times, not just "nearby"
- No swimming off boats without adult in water

**Hotels**
- Never assume pools have lifeguards — most don't
- Check fence/gate security
- Supervision rules apply everywhere
